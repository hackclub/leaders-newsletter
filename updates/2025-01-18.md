## Design a Cookie Cutter. Get it Shipped! 🍪

As a Great British Baking Show enthusiast, I love this project. There's a number of ways you could go through this with your club. It is great for *ALL* skill levels.

There is a great step-by-step [guide](https://bakebuild.hackclub.com/pdf/How%20to%20Make%20a%20Cookie%20Cutter.pdf). It walks you all the way through submission. Seriously, check it out. You could present it at the front of the room, let people go through independently, or both! This takes about 60 - 90 minutes to complete. **Submit yours by February 11th.**

## Build a Program. Fit it in a QR Code. Profit?? 📸

I'm the grumpy old man who groans when restaurants force me to scan a QR code for the menu. I promise I'll change! Build a game, app, calculator, webpage, portfolio, or anything in between! Confine it to 2953 bytes and anyone can access it without internet! Ok, now I see why restaurants do this......

This project is for *ALL* skill levels. There is this [tutorial-ish](https://saycheese.hackclub.com/tutorial.html) to help you and your club out! **Submit yours by January 26th.**

## Create an API. Get a Mini Server! 🥧

Did I mention my favorite pie is raspberry? *Ok*, that's irrelevant Jared. Create an original API using any programming language or framework that you prefer and get a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W to host it on! The API can be anything you want. The possibilities are endless!

Oh yeah, the top 3 submissions will receive a Raspberry Pi Sense Hat!

This project can be for *ALL* skill levels! Stay tuned for a tutorial, it's in the works! 🏗️ **Submit yours by March 10th.**

## Make Tools. Solve Problems. Get a Microcontroller!

Oh, my dad has lots of these in his auto body shop. Oh wait, never mind. A tool is something that helps you and other hackers solve a problem. It should be easy for people to use and it should be usable by lots of different people.

This project is mostly for intermediate skill levels or above, but the focus is on smaller projects. So you should only need to spend 12 hours or less! **Submit yours by January 27th.**

Also, [@lux](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U01G0Q9K998) will be running two huddles *everyday* to help anyone who needs it! Thanks Lux! 🙂 (12pm EST and 10pm EST).

## Code a Virtual Pet. Get a Tamagotchi Clone! 🐈 🦮

My favorite part of my day is petting my cat, Toast 🍞. He isn't a fan of other animals, so here's my chance to get another pet without upsetting him! Draw and design your character and backgrounds. Code your game. Then receive your console in the mail!

This project is recommended for intermediate skill levels or above. **Submit yours before January 31st.**

## Ship a Project. Get a Shirt. Go to a Local Tavern! 🏴‍☠️

This is a great way to celebrate all your troubles on the seas. If you ship a project for [High Seas](https://hack.club/scallywag), we will ship you a custom shirt 👕 and cover travel costs to get you to a local tavern so you can meet with your fellow scallywags in-person!

See if there is a tavern near your or organize one of your own! **The ships anchor in ports on January 31st! ⚓️**

Check it out [here](http://highseas.hackclub.com/tavern)!
