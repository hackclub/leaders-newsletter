# **Leader Newsletter - More YSWS, Hackathons, & Voting!**

Hello leaders! üëã

(FYI: You're receiving this email because you're a club leader or in the process of becoming one.)

It feels like Scrapyard-eve right now. Everyone else ready? I still don't know where I'm going (procrastination ftw), but I do know I'm going to see some outlandish creations regardless. See if there's [one](https://scrapyard.hackclub.com) near you, it's not too late!

In this newsletter, I've got some projects with challenges needing creativity to solve. Ways to launch those to the stratosphere. Then a chance to exercise your voting rights by choosing Hack Club's top cookie cutters! Check it out below and let me know what you think. üò∫

### **Design a 3D Printer. Build it.** üèóÔ∏è

What's the craziest 3D printer design you can think of? I personally like the idea of having one you can wear, like a backpack. A new age of fashion. One we might see at the Met Gala. Just kidding, who cares about that.

This is a chance for you to design a 3D printer fitting your exact needs. Maybe it needs solar panels, wheels so it can drive or something, *I don't know*. Plan yours from scratch and you can get funding from Hack Club to build it! Submit by **March 31st at 11:59pm EST**! 

Here's Alex with his custom 3D printer!

This is actually his passport photo. (But not really).

### **Write a Program. Get a LED Matrix.**

Oh goody, another challenge, but with *constraints*! For this project you only get 64 pixels, 5 buttons, and a piezo buzzer to play with. Your program needs to work on an 8x8 LED matrix. Use the [editor](https://blackbox.hackclub.com/editor/) to make an interactive program. Submit it by **March 15 at 11:59pm EST** and we'll send you a portable device to run it on!

Personally, I'd make mine a continuous line of crawling kitties. üêà üêà‚Äç‚¨õ

### **Make Something in the Terminal. Win a Raspberry Pi!**

This is the first I'm learning Star Wars can be played through the terminal on your computer. I always wondered how I could make old school movies seem more retro.

Alright Jared, back on topic. This is a YSWS challenge where you build and ship a command-line application. It can be literally anything as long as it runs in the terminal. Maybe a tool, game, or a useful script. It's up to you! Submit by **March 19 at 11:59pm EST** to earn a raspberry pi!

## **Build a Project. Send it 100,000ft!** üöÄ

Ya know, whenever I complete a project I'm proud of, I always think it'd be great if I could somehow launch it to the stratosphere. Then it'd *finally* be a masterpiece. 

Now **you** can! ü´µ

Here's how it works. You build a project and track your time. If you reach 100 hours to qualify, you could get a travel stipend for Boston and launch it to 100,00ft! Then you can recover your project and analyze any data you wanted to track.

# **BakeBuild Clubs Competition - Voting** üó≥Ô∏è

A few weeks ago, Clubs were given the option to submit designs for a competition within BakeBuild. As a fan of democracy, I figured I'd share the submissions with everyone so we can all vote who wins Hack Club's baking glory! Winners also get sent a 3D print of their design, dry cookie mix, a cookie drawing from [Graham's](https://hackclub.com/team/) daughter, stickers, and Jared's everlasting admiration. ‚ù§Ô∏è Quite the haul if you ask me.

<img src="https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/meips/ADKq_NZXWAWjGEL6xryvQt4_iFe9oknmyo45fk_HytIyvi4lJARNkbMp45hiwUqhPiSpY72_VvaoDJnjO3N1z5ayzcNgL1M4nmh-VPkByvX7OVJm6C7x6aGCCt3TL4PG8KSU0CN9sn5F6dCips-siLn601oE9gI=s0-d-e1-ft#https://d3b9kr64nievew.cloudfront.net/cm7m3n0zj01hdo70kds8roxbp/cm7z13z41005i12o15mm0mfhs.png" style="width: 170px;">

# **Club Showcase** üéâ

Bah√ßelievler G√∂kku≈üaƒüƒ± Koleji Hack Club

This club leader, Sayhan, has done some amazing planning this year. He challenges his club to learn new skills and practice them, even if school is closed for a snow day. They had all just experimented in Tinkercad, so he figured, "why not use it ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø". He gave the task of making something 'winter/snow themed' to go along with their weather. 

But his club pushed back. "Uhm, Sayhan, wdym snow themed? What if we get stuck?"

As a teacher, this is where I am truly impressed. Sayhan stood firm and gave options to entice people to think harder and be creative. Here was his response to his club; "Snow themed could be anything, snowflakes, snowplow, a mug of hot chocolate or even a shovel, whatever fits you right. And if you get stuck? Well that's good, because then you can learn. I'm here for a reason and will help out whenever someone wants." 

From the activity:

But that's not all. There's a table tennis club in their school who they decided to collaborate with. For one meeting, both clubs will play ping pong. In another, they will all make a simple pong game! üèì

**Sayhan**, you are setting an amazing example. Thanks üôÇ

Side Note: 

Did you know Table Tennis has also been called; Whiff Whaff, Pom-Pom, Pim-Pam, Netto, Clip-Clap,Tennis de Salon, along with others.

Bitti! (That's Turkish!). At least Google says it is, correct me if I'm wrong Sayhan! Either way, DM me on Slack and tell me about your club! - [@jps](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U07HEH4N8UV)
