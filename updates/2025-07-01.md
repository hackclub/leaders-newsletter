# **Leader Newsletter - Summer!**

Ahoy mateys! üëã

Happy summer break! It's been a heater here at HQ with a couple of 90+ degree days. ü•µ As a person born and raised in the north, this is simply unacceptable. Anyone able to code me a more comfortable climate?

Okay, back to being realistic. Many clubs are taking a short hiatus from meeting during this time, but in case you aren't, here's some content you could use for your warm weather meetings! ‚òÄÔ∏è

### Build stuff. Get stuff. **Repeat.**

**For you:**
Build personal coding projects and earn shells. üêö Spend these on awesome prizes like Raspberry Pis, server hosting credits, 3D printers, or other tools to fuel your next creation!

**For your club:**
Use this to encourage your members to improve their skills and build projects, or pick a topic and have everyone build a project relating to it! YSWS projects count for this event as well, if you have beginners, get them started with Boba, Swirl, Toppings, Grub, or Waffles!

### Introduce the Club to JavaScript! üßá

If your club has worked through the other web dev YSWS, they should be feeling comfortable with HTML and CSS by this point. Now it's time to introduce them to JavaScript! Here's a [guide](https://waffles-guide.my.canva.site/) for you to use as a visual in your meetings and help members walkthrough these new concepts.

We will send your club $10 for every website including:

- 2+ webpages
- 5+ HTML and CSS features on each
- 3+ JavaScript functions on each

*See the [requirements](https://waffles.hackclub.com/requirements.html)*

Oscillart is a YSWS for the Athena Awards. In this, you create an app that designs art and music based off of your favorite songs and melodies. Plus, you get the opportunity to integrate science, math, art, and tech! By spending 5-6 hours creating your web app, you'll earn artifacts you can redeem for prizes such as Framework Laptops, iPads, Steam subscriptions, and more. In addition, if you code **3 projects** and spend a total of **30 hours coding** you qualify for our New York hackathon!!! To earn artifacts, you must be a girl or nonbinary teen, i.e. someone who can qualify for the Athena Awards.
