Hello leaders! üëã

Are you looking for new ways to throw üçï pizza parties with your club? Maybe you've been thinking of traveling to Shanghai. *Maaaaaybe* you're just looking for a friendly baking competition. Well, if you answered yes to any of these super specific scenarios, then I have things for *you*! ü´µ

# Pizza Grant üö®

### You Ship Projects. We Ship Pizza. üçï

A huge aspect of Hack Club's [philosophy](https://hackclub.com/philosophy) is learning while building. I want to support clubs who do this*. So we are offering leaders **$5 per shipped project from their club**. This way when all of the hard work is finished, you can celebrate with some pizza, *every time*.

Here's how it works:

1. Plan and ship projects with your club.
2. Everyone submits this [form](https://airtable.com/appSUAc40CDu6bDAp/pagvu2xGhfsMC8AOL/form).
3. DM or email @jps for the virtual card.
4. Buy food for your next meeting!

*Fries? On a PIZZA!?*

This is a trial for the next couple weeks, but I *really* want it to stay. Show us it works. Plan a [YSWS](https://ysws.hackclub.com) activity with your club.

Here are some quick ones:

üç™ [BakeBuild](https://bakebuild.hackclub.com) <> 30-45min <> [#bakebuild](https://app.slack.com/client/T0266FRGM/C0844MV2JM9)

üßã [Boba Drops](https://boba.hackclub.com) <> 30-60min <> [#boba](https://app.slack.com/client/T0266FRGM/C06UJR8QW0M)

ü™™ [PCB Hacker Card](https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/hacker-card) <> 60min <> [#onboard-help](https://app.slack.com/client/T0266FRGM/C0593MG26TT)

ü™Ñ [Make Your Own Electronic Trash Out of a Magic Hat](https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/components-in-a-cap) <> 60min <> [#onboard-help](https://app.slack.com/client/T0266FRGM/C0593MG26TT)

I know this grant is only rewarding Hack Club projects. It hasn't reached the final form yet and will have ways of including other projects in the future.

# Clubs Competition - BakeBuild üç™

Ok, maybe not exactly a baking competition. But it's baking themed at least. Anyway, anyone in a club can participate, even if you've already done [BakeBuild](https://bakebuild.hackclub.com) before! There will be 4 categories people will vote on.

**Categories:**
- Funniest
- Most Unique
- Best Impression Cutter
- Best Club Collection
  - A whole club submission. Establish a theme with your club and ship designs that follow this theme.

**Prizes:**
- 3D print of cookie cutter from HQ
- Cookie mix (Jared packaged himself)
- Hack Club sticker pack

Here's a [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/107gyD3WF9XUKwTzEKLNr45agF14Rh1ovf5LBWWarH5Q/edit?usp=sharing) for the competition. Feel free to make copies and edit to fit your needs. Show it during your meeting or send it to your members!

## Ship a 3D Design for a Pegboard. Get a Pegboard!

Whether it's tools, tech components, or candy; they all need to be organized for an optimized workspace. Here's your chance to do the same for yours. Design a 3D model that's compatible with the Ikea Pegboard and Hack Club will send you one!

<img src="https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/meips/ADKq_NYPCgbrBKvUPw4l0JyMWLftb18FThXIQnPydVH9OwibR2eqMes_JD7N_ODpaB_dQMsMB7-q_NlBlMz4S_YJeaAHzb1Ir4y6HCQseOU9IBMdayBO2bgtupZZ2xv0Hau-3n6gvfxm3QcOQfU7AUpKIiSqFJM=s0-d-e1-ft#https://d3b9kr64nievew.cloudfront.net/cm69py6kk011u13ii82mkov9h/cm6la7m3703wgm3c5q0gj4ewo.png" style="width: 180px;">

This is a good project for beginners as well as any CAD skill level. Here's a [guide](https://printboard.hackclub.com/guides/) using both OnShape and TinkerCAD to help those who are new to designing 3D models. Although, in order to qualify for the Pegboard, people will need to go beyond the tutorial and make their designs more complicated. But I like to fancy myself as a TinkerCAD kind of guy, so feel free to email me if you want to discuss ways to do this with your club!

## Build a Game. Run a Game Jam in Shanghai. üá®üá≥

Yes, you read the title right. If you spend the next two months building a game, you could earn the opportunity to travel to Shanghai and manage a game jam in a cafe with other Hack Clubbers! Here's how it works:

Every week there will be a Zoom call for people to join so they can gain achievements, play each other's games, and learn. [@Thomas](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U041FQB8VK2) will be making his first game alongside all of you! Here's how you can earn a travel stipend so you can get there and play:

- Spend 100+ hours building your game
- Include no spoken or written words in the game (so any nationality can play!)
- Ship your game to the Steam Store (30min playable content)

The kickoff event will be **Saturday at 7:30pm EST**. So sign-up *ASAP*.

I'd love to see a club go to Shanghai together, then I could try and justify me going! But seriously, this sounds like a great adventure if you have some members who are motivated to create and travel.
