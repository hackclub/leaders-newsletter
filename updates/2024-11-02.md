Ahoy leaders üëã

(FYI: You're receiving this email because you're a club leader or in the process of becoming one.)

*Oh no*, here's Jared writing the newsletter again, what will go wrong this time!? Just kidding, hopefully. But there are *exciting* things happening around Hack Club. We had a keynote speaker at GitHub Universe and now Akon is a celebrity üé• We also have new activities and events to participate in. Check them out below!

### Build personal projects. Get free stuff.

I hear from many leaders how much they loved arcade. I mean, who wouldn't? You work on your own projects and get prizes for doing so. Well matey, here's your chance to do it again!

Here's how it works if you're a landlubber just boarding the ship. You **make** your project, which can be anything from building a personal website to creating a video game. **Submit** these to begin building your chest of Dubloons üí∞ Then **spend** in the shop on prizes. My personal favorite is the autographed photos of our esteemed HQ matey, Graham. A great portrait for the captain's quarters üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

Here's a little teaser of the spoils for you scallywags

Just as the title suggests, you create a CSS animation and get art supplies! Putting that 'A' in STEAM! Here's how it works. **Design** a creative CSS animation in CodePen. **Submit** it. **Get** supplies. Profit. üé®

Here's an example from Lilia! I call it the *Wobble Box*, but maybe you'll have a better name.

## Workshop Set-up Videos

Since I suggested these as great beginning of the year activities, I decided to make some video tutorials on how to set-up both of these for your club. They are *easy* to set-up! You just have to make it through hearing me nervously record myself for all to hear.

## GitHub Universe

I may never be famous, but at least now I know someone who is! This felt like watching family on TV. Hack Club was invited to GitHub Universe to brag about how awesome we are and roll out High Seas. I loved seeing Hack Clubbers in the stream chat cheering on Acon!

On September 29th, **Kevin** and his club were able to host yvrHacks 2024, British Columbia's biggest youth Hackathon! Over 60 high school students from 6 different cities came together at Vancouver Independent School for Science and Technology for a 9-hour session of hacking together and working on projects. Here they are!

## Collaborate with me!

I am seeing many clubs beginning to have their first meetings! This brought many success stories, but it also included difficulties for some. I've had leaders reach out or post in the **#leaders** channel about issues they're having with their club. I've seen stressors including disruptive members, people not showing up, or clubs fizzling out. If you're a leader who has been facing some form of adversity, message me and don't navigate through it alone! I am always here to help and am willing to schedule Zoom calls so we can talk about your club and brainstorm solutions together! I've also seen many people in the #leaders channel giving great advice. So I encourage everyone to be proactive about their club and collaborate with myself or the community!

Here's a [link](https://highseas.hackclub.com/) to join Slack if you haven't done so already. Find the #leaders channel. I can't stress enough how great of a resource the community is! üí™
