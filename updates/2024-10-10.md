# **October Leader Newsletter**

Hello leaders 👋

(FYI: You're receiving this email because you're a club leader or in the process of becoming one.)

I apologize for the *disaster* of a newsletter I sent last month, which featured a couple typos and was disorienting to read. 😵‍💫 I really appreciate the feedback! I'm hoping to get better with each one. Anyway, I'm ecstatic fall is here! Now I get to wear the eccentric sweaters I buy impulsively at thrift shops thinking they'll give me a personality. But that's a different problem. Check out the activities and events happening around Hack Club!

Feeling a bit scary? Put that terror to good use. Join the effort to make Boba Manor as spooky as possible by designing a haunted room (website). Once enough rooms are submitted, we'll open the manor for all to experience!

But wait, there's prizes!

## Club Showcases

I just want to show off some neat things I've seen posted around Slack. Lately I've noticed a lot of awesome ways leaders are promoting their clubs. Sometimes it feels like these are all led by a bunch of graphic designers because the advertisements I see are *great!*

Haroon made this poster to give more info about Hack Club. Many of the official posters we offer are specific to individual projects. They wanted to explain more. In my opinion, they did so in a way that's informative, visually pleasing, and straight to the point. I just wanted to share in case other leaders are struggling to do the same. Thanks Haroon 🙂

Peter designed this trifold poster for their club fair. They wanted to share a [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yF4yv6ZF22YGGy2XfLPuNYfRlvDX0mu-) so others can do the same if they aren't as design focused and artistic (like me). Here's a picture of it in the wild with a herd of curious students so you can see it in action. Thanks Peter 😎

## The Boreal Express

Check out the latest documentary about the Hackathon that traveled across Canada! *Or did it?* 😱 But seriously, this video is impressive. I think it shows the resiliency of Hack Clubbers. A quality I've noticed to be especially common amongst leaders.

## Orpheus Doodles

Some new leaders have already seen, but I'm trying to spice up my welcoming letters with some Orpheus drawings. I'm not an artist, and Orpheus is fairly straight forward, but I'd love to see what other people come up with. Maybe I'll try and start using them in the future. Here's one:

Send me your best Orpheus doodles on Slack! I wonder if we can make the best one into a sticker......
