# **December Leaders Newsletter**

Hello leaders!

(FYI: You're receiving this email because you're a club leader or in the process of becoming one.)

It's December, one of the most polarizing months of the year for people. There are great holidays, but it also means cold weather for most of us. If you aren't a winter outdoors person, then it's time to get cozy with your coding projects! Here's some new things happening (along with some other info) to help occupy while you stay warm! Also, please don't hack the weather. I kind of like the cold.

(Here's a quick cozy/cosy fact I *just* discovered. Cozy with a 'Z' is the preferred American🇺🇸 way of spelling. Cosy with a 'S' is preferred for the British🇬🇧 and Australians🇦🇺. Canadians🇨🇦 use *both*. So wherever you are in the world, pretend I spelled it to match your preferences. 😏)

## High Seas Pizza Grant - $5 per sign-up! 🍕

I just wanted to remind leaders of this food opportunity and how to get the virtual card, especially because I wasn't entirely clear the first time. *Hey*, *I'm still learning over here.*

Here's how it works:

1. Sign-up for [High Seas](https://hack.club/scallywag) and log some coding on Hackatime.
2. Fill out this [form](https://forms.hackclub.com/high-seas-pizza-fund).

Confession time. When I first started working for Hack Club, I thought everyone was talking about Rust, the video game my friends play. Now I know it is yet another programming language. Don't tell anyone 🤫

## Leader Showcase 🎤

Here's a brief look inside the life of a club leader. You all do your best to plan meetings, raise engagement, recruit members, along with a litany of other tasks. But one of the responsibilities which isn't discussed often is becoming a delivery driver for YSWS rewards. Here's Sahiti carefully delivering 15 fraps to her club after finishing the [Hackaccino](https://fraps.hackclub.com) Workshop 🧋

## Some Channels for You 💌

When people talk about why they joined Hack Club, a top response is because it's a community of like-minded coders. For this reason, Slack is one of the greatest resources Hack Club has to offer. It's a place to collaborate, ask questions, or joke around in some goofy channels.

<u>Here are the ones I think are important for leaders:</u>

**#announcements** - Where you'll find any new events happening around Hack Club.

**#leaders** - A channel for club leaders (YOU 🫵) to collaborate and ask each other questions.

**#hq** - A place to interact with Hack Club Headquarters.

**#pizza-party** - Apply for the pizza grant here. Just enter the command /pizza to begin.

  
<u>Individual YSWS & event channels for discussing or asking questions:</u>

**#high-seas**, **#boba**, **#fraps**, **#mc-modding**, **#blot**, **#sprig**, **#onboard-help**, **#cascade**, **#cider**, **#rust**

There are way more channels than this. Just type the # symbol in the search bar and begin typing to see if a channel exists! My personal favorite is **#cats**. 🐈

This was just a quick update for everyone! Message me on Slack and let me know how your club is doing! - [@jps](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U07HEH4N8UV)
