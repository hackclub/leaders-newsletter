# **Leader Newsletter - Ice Cream, Cookies, Cider, and Art!**

Hello leaders! 👋

(FYI: You're receiving this email because you're a club leader or in the process of becoming one.)

What's *swirling* everyone? Ok, maybe using swirl as a verb in this way is a bit of a stretch. I'm just excited for this new YSWS launch. I also have some other great things to share as well. There are returning projects 🏗️, events 🎪, artistic releases 🎨, and mentorship opportunities. Check them out below!

### AKA Boba II, but with Ice Cream! 🍦

Clubs account for nearly 60% of all [Boba Drops](https://boba.hackclub.com) ships. *Wow*. I wish I could give all you leaders a big high five for this. Ok, how about an air five? 3-2-1 ✋! I hope someone out there did this with me.

Swirl is an opportunity for clubs who finished Boba Drops to continue developing their web dev skills by making their websites legen-dairy🥛. This project will require participants to make another website or improve on the one they made for Boba Drops. They'll add more webpages, learn how to implement more unique features, and can even practice a simple Javascript feature if they'd like!

You can also level-up by adding more scoops (unique features) to your website. This means you can get *more* ice cream! 🍨

### Help Design HQ's Mural 🎨

The illustrious HQ is a unique building situated in the center of Shelburne's tiny village. But it has one problem; one side is completely blank. It has the audacity to look like just a normal building. *Unacceptable*. I don't know about the customs or traditions of where you're from. But here, in Vermont, we slap murals on all those empty canvases.

<img src="https://d3b9kr64nievew.cloudfront.net/cm83emep5008jk40c79o6woi5/cm8q86m5r03n2mp2md9t0avsp.jpg" style="width: 100%; border: 2px solid #000000;">

You can help contribute! Send a sketch of your full color design to [#hq-mural](https://app.slack.com/client/T0266FRGM/C08GW9A6FCK) for a chance to have it added to the wall! If your sketch is one of the ideas we use in our mashup of submissions, we'll ship you some conductive paint and stickers of the design! 🖌️ 🖼️

Sketches are due anytime before **May 1st at 11:59pm EST**.

Here's some last words of wisdom for those who will be Swirling. A balanced diet is simply an ice cream in each hand. - [@jps](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U07HEH4N8UV)
