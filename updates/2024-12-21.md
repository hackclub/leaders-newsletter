# **Holiday Break Leader Newsletter**

Hello leaders! üéÑ
 
(FYI: You're receiving this email because you're a club leader or in the process of becoming one.)
 
Winter Break is here! I know I'm excited to wake up late, spend hours petting (annoying) my cat, and watch too much of my favorite comfort show (Seinfeld). It's also a time when many people are looking for something to fill their broken routine. This could be your chance to provide that something! Carpe Diem!
 
In this newsletter you'll find videos to help set-up High Seas and Hackatime, YSWS holiday events, new projects, along with other things I wanted to show off. So grab your coca, there's things for me to show! ‚òïÔ∏è

### Winter Break Zoom Meeting ‚ùÑÔ∏è
Winter break is a great time to recharge, but it's also when many find themselves with a broken routine. Sure, people love sitting back and doing nothing, but many are looking for an activity to fill the time. This is your chance to provide some consistency. Host a virtual meeting and keep your members coding! You could do one of the projects below or simply get everyone set-up on [High Seas](https://highseas.hackclub.com/?utm_medium=hc-channel&utm_campaign=clubs&utm_source=clubs) with Hackatime!
 
If this sounds good to you, then send out an email chain or start a group chat with your members. Find a time that works best for everyone!

Here is a [link](https://toolbox.hackclub.com/zoom) on how to set-up Zoom Pro for your meeting!

### High Seas and Hackatime Set-up!

I've heard from a few clubs they are having difficulty getting members on High Seas and coding with Hackatime. So here are a couple videos you can either send or show to help them through the process!
 
How to join High Seas and Slack [here](https://drive.google.com/file/u/4/d/16Uv1t8mnSa4a-QIof64XPrUgJtbQqBu_/view?usp=sharing)!
How to install Hackatime on Mac OS [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YfSlCNUr28vpnEhPFS6odquvNHEGfwYk/view)!
 
The main issues I've seen is when VS Code isn't installed. Once it is, it should be smooth sailing! ‚õµÔ∏è

### HQ on Holiday Break üéÑ
 
Most Hack Club employees will be out of office from Dec. 23rd - 27th. There will be a couple people on Slack answering basic questions on the [#high-seas](https://app.slack.com/client/T0266FRGM/C07PZMBUNDS), [#high-seas-help](https://app.slack.com/client/T0266FRGM/C07PZNMBPBN), or [highseas@hackclub.com](highseas@hackclub.com)! But feel free to discuss in YSWS specific channels as well!

Phew, that was a lot. I hope everyone has a restful break, a happy holiday, and a great New Year! üéâ - [@jps](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U07HEH4N8UV)
