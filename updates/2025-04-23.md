# **Leader Newsletter - Solder, HackCraft, and The THING.**

Hello leaders! 👋

(FYI: You're receiving this email because you're a club leader or in the process of becoming one.)

Apologies for this newsletter taking longer than normal. I've been knee deep in swirling ice cream. I also promise that will be my only lame attempt for a Swirl joke in this newsletter. 🍦

There's some unique projects to announce right now! A new YSWS for those who missed The Bin. One that's returning due to popular demand. Then a growing monstrosity *you* could make even more monstrous. 🧌

### Make a Circuit Board. Get a Kit to Assemble It!

I ❤️ when YSWS authors are thinking of clubs. HQ must consider me a broken record with my non-stop questions asking how leaders can facilitate their projects, if there's any beginner tutorials, etc.

Well, [@acon](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U04KEK4TS72) decided halt my constant griping, because this project is *amazing* for clubs. Especially if you were disappointed to see The Bin discontinue.

Start a workshop and we'll send you a kit for every member who submits! Have people go through the tutorial so they can get started, learn how each part works, then make schematics! Send pictures of your club assembling and we will send swag! 👕

Have your members make:

• Keychains 🔑
• Name badges 📛  
• Fidget toys 🪀

Run a workshop and submit yours before **May 30th at 11:59pm EST**.

### Ship a Mod. Get Minecraft. ⛏️

It's back! I was actually just on a call with a new leader who is attempting to make a mod with Orpheus. I thought this was pretty neat as someone who fancies themselves a Hack Club enthusiast.

The organizers of this look to have done their best to provide resources for people to learn how! You or your members can get started with this [tutorial](https://hackcraft.hackclub.com/guide). It'll show how to setup a project, test newly coded features, and begin making a mod. **Submit before June 1 at 11:59pm EST.**

### Hack on the Same PCB. Let Chaos Ensue.

During my time teaching in a makerspace, the common idea people had was making some monstrosity in a CAD program and 3D printing it. There's just something about being a mad scientist that's *so* attractive.

The Thing has the same mad vibes. Except this time, it's a *world* 🌎 full of Dr. Frankensteins! Everyone will hack on the same PCB, one after another. Each person gets two days to add a thing and stream their work in #the-thing.

Here's [@malted](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U03DFNYGPCN) giving his intro:

This can also be a great discussion with your club! During a meeting, bring up The Thing and look at the log of projected additions. Talk about what crazy features your club should add when their time comes.

**When does it end?** It ends when it dies. How does it die? When we stop feeding it.

So KEEP 👏 FEEDING 👏 THE 👏 THING 👏

# Swirl - Sticker Designs🍦

Uh oh, Jared's talking about Swirl again.

That's because I am *ecstatic* about how this project has gone so far. Now it's time to make it official with a sticker. I've had a couple of superb designs floated on Slack, but I wanted to make sure anyone who wanted to attempt had a chance!

Design a sticker and send it to us before **April 28th**! It could become the official Swirl sticker we send to clubs!

Here's some great designs to get the creativity started:

To submit a design, simply reply to this email or DM me on Slack at [@jps](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U07HEH4N8UV)!

Apologies for the tardiness and brevity of this newsletter. I was (still am) sick and wasn't able to focus on getting this out to all of you. I plan to be more timely in the future. Anyway, stay tuned and keep building! - [@jps](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U07HEH4N8UV)
