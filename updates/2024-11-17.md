## Run a High Seas Meeting. *Get Pizza.* 🍕

Here's another way to get your crew fed! We are offering $5 for every person who signs-up and does some coding on the High Seas during one of your meetings. Here's how it works:

1. Plan a High Seas themed meeting where everyone signs-up [here](https://hack.club/scallywag) and does a coding project.
2. Have members (and you) enter their email on this [form](https://forms.hackclub.com/high-seas-pizza-fund).
3. Message [@jps](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U07HEH4N8UV) on Slack to get a virtual card to buy food for your club!

Also, I definitely used someone's pixelated pizza they made for the Pizza Grant. I wonder if they'll notice.....

## High Seas as a Resource for Club Leaders 📚

**'Double Dip'** on potential rewards by working on these Hack Club projects. People can earn the regular YSWS rewards while simultaneously collecting Doubloons in High Seas!

🍓[Coding Jams](https://jams.hackclub.com)  🧋[Boba Drops](https://boba.hackclub.com)  ☕️[Hackaccino](https://fraps.hackclub.com)  🎮[Sprig](https://sprig.hackclub.com)  

⚙️[Blot](https://blot.hackclub.com)  🧃[Cider](https://cider.hackclub.com)  ⛏️[HackCraft](https://hackcraft.hackclub.com)  🎨[Cascade](https://cascade.hackclub.com)  💻[Browser Buddy](https://browserbuddy.hackclub.com)

**Turn your own activities into a YSWS!** Any coding project can count toward High Seas. If you've had trouble getting members engaged with other tasks, this program offers you the chance to incentivize their coding work.

Example: 

Your club finished the Boba Workshop by going through the [tutorial](https://workshops.hackclub.com/personal_website/). Yay! *But now what?* Have them apply and practice their skills by making a website of their own or collaborating on one for the club! Using the skills they just learned will be challenging, but at least through High Seas they are getting paid by the hour to practice!

DM [@jps](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U07HEH4N8UV) on Slack or ask in the [#leaders](https://app.slack.com/client/T0266FRGM/C02PA5G01ND?cdn_fallback=2) channel if you'd like to brainstorm ideas for your club!

## Leader Showcase 📸

**Edlyn** and **Caroline** run a Hack Club for middle schoolers and recently facilitated a Boba Workshop with over *70 participants*! They even made a website dedicated to the workshop! Seriously, check it out. It has awesome projects (8 are dedicated to cats!), a picture of their club, and helpful videos on various web development topics. *Fantastic* leading by these two. 🤗

Here's their club in action!
