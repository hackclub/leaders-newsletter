# **Leader Newsletter - YSWS Projects, Cafe, & HCB**

Hello leaders! üëã

(FYI: You're receiving this email because you're a club leader or in the process of becoming one.)

Anyone else sick of the cold yet? ü•∂ HQ is under about 4ft of snow and I'm dodging icicles every time I go outside. Those things are *sharp*. I beg of you Mother Nature, *please* give me anything above 40 degrees. üôè 

Anyway, I've got a variety of things to show you. We've got new (or returning) YSWS projects, some info about HCB, and a tool to incentivize your members to do coding homework from your club!

## **The Web is Your Canvas - BrowserBuddy is BACK!** üé®

Here's your chance to personalize your browsing experience. If anyone makes a Chrome extension, we will pay to have it posted to the Chrome Web Store! Then everyone can download and share your visions for the World Wide Webs. **Submissions end after March 19th.**

You can all get started with this [tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started) from Google. It'll walk you through making your first Chrome extension. You'll also find walkthroughs for how to make others with specific tasks.

As someone who grew up during the turn of the century, this is a blast from the past. If anyone codes a game (or something else) with J2ME, we will send flip phones! **Submissions end after April 7th.**

### **Join a Huddle. Post Projects. Get Cups.**

This is a nifty way of bringing people together, even if working independently. Simply join a huddle on Slack and begin building. When you leave, ship your progress and earn Cups for the time spent participating. These can be used on prizes that level-up as you go ‚òùÔ∏è

Here's a preview of the prize progression:

**How can I use this for clubs you ask?** 

*Wow* I wish I could give prizes to my former students when I assigned homework. Now **you** can! If people in your club haven't completed the project during your meeting, tell them to join a huddle and work on it there! This way, they can be incentivized to work on their project outside of club time and earn prizes while doing it!

This is a great resource to collect donations and send invoices for your club or hackathon. When you join HCB, you'll have access to a suite of tools including debit cards, a free domain name, stickers, 1password licenses, event insurance, and more!

Have questions? Office hours are open to **anyone.** You can learn how HCB works, what HCB is, or how to be more successful in using HCB in your organization.
This is a great resource if you've got friends or classmates interested in joining HCB for them to ask questions and learn more! No question is too silly, and they're always happy to help - who knows, you might find someone has the same question or query as you!

More details will be released on exact schedules, but to make sure all time zones have equal opportunity, it will probably change slightly from week to week. We'll always give you good notice of an upcoming session, and they'll all be over Zoom! Find out more, and RSVP at [https://forms.hackclub.com/hcb-office-hours](https://forms.hackclub.com/hcb-office-hours).

## **Leader Showcase** üé§

**STEM Egypt** has been busy the past couple weeks. They are a small team of leaders with a club of over *100* members! They managed to ship over 80 websites with nearly all being accepted. Obviously this was no small task. They made a [website](https://workshops.stemcsclub.org/) so others can do the same if they aren't as design focused and artistic (like me). Here's a picture of it in the wild with a herd of curious students so you can see it in action. Thanks Peter üòé
