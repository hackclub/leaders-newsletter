# **Leader Newsletter - Grub, Pizza Party, Athena Awards, & Circuit Island**

Hello leaders! üëã

(FYI: You're receiving this email because you're a club leader or in the process of becoming one.)

A quick newsletter for you all, sent from Dublin! üáÆüá™ I'm excited to announce a new workshop focused YSWS to help gain efficiency with coding websites, as well as a couple more Hack Club sponsored events!

Just an FYI, I'll be away from HQ until June 2nd. If you have any questions about your club or workshops, feel free to email afonso@hackclub.com, karthik@hackclub.com, or sahiti@hackclub.com. They are all part of the clubs team and would be happy to help!

### Learn Tailwind CSS. Get Junk Food. üçî üçü ü•§

There are workshops for beginners to learn how to build their first website, add multiple pages, and implement various CSS features. Now, here's a project to make this all more efficient with Tailwind CSS!

Build a website using only HTML and Tailwind CSS, get a grant to purchase junk food (or something healthier if you're calorie counting)! Add more features and increase the size of your meal:

Never used Tailwind before? Here's a [guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRzZoNoMDwq340x6XvRoZqSOLxQ2tJk3w-t1_hH9CI4XRNzF-34hydf4bZ1lEFX9gKyxp1ANrnfSxDR/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.p) to help your meetings! Display it at the front of the room or send the link to members for them to work through independently. There's also a [gallery](https://grub.hackclub.com/gallery.html) for people to see examples or check on their project's status. Here's my [personal favorite](https://yasina74.github.io/burgs/) *so far*.

### Toronto Meet-up!

On Saturday, May 31st, Hack Clubbers are meeting on Toronto Island to tinker with breadboards and circuits (duh, it's in the name). They'd love for club leaders and/or your members to join!

Never done anything with hardware before? This is the perfect chance to get your hands messy and learn! Together in groups, you'll each get to make something of your own and we'll teach you everything you need to know.

**Trip to the Island, snacks, and hardware kits are all included.** You don't need to pay for anything, and we'll take a group transit trip from Union to the Island.
