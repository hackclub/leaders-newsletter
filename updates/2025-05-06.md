# **Leader Newsletter - Toppings, Shipwrecked, and Framework Laptop 12**

Hello leaders! üëã

(FYI: You're receiving this email because you're a club leader or in the process of becoming one.)

What makes a game have depth? An immersive world? Passionate characters? Maybe a side quest? What about *three*? Well, hopefully you're playing along with me at this point. Below you'll find a new CSS focused YSWS, a chance to be stranded, and a way to win a Framework Laptop 12!

## A CSS Side Quest

When I review websites for Boba Drops, most of the code is HTML with just one example of CSS. Well, after thinking about this, it made sense. This is the requirement for Boba Drops. *Let's switch it up.*

Toppings are additional ingredients to add flavor for your Boba Tea, just like CSS for websites. It's time to add piquancy to those websites. Start a fresh website or continue building off the one you submitted for Boba Drops or Swirl!

This YSWS was designed with clubs in mind! A [tutorial](https://onedrive.live.com/:p:/g/personal/15C5992DC255D3FE/EZpKrymObTpEqCy4DLOpRGIBX1dY9l2cwSr1wP9TYIRyJg?resid=15C5992DC255D3FE!s29af4a9a6d8e443aa82cb80cb3a94462&ithint=file%2Cpptx&migratedtospo=true&redeem=aHR0cHM6Ly8xZHJ2Lm1zL3AvYy8xNWM1OTkyZGMyNTVkM2ZlL0VacEtyeW1PYlRwRXFDeTRETE9wUkdJQlgxZFk5bDJjd1NyMXdQOVRZSVJ5Smc) is provided to help review important steps from Boba Drops as well as add various toppings (CSS) to the website.

## Code to Survive the Island

Not literally, of course. But this is a chance to pretend during a 4-day story-based hackathon on Cathleen Stone Island in the Boston Harbor! I don't think I could give a better explanation, so here's the deets:

# Leader Showcase üèÜ

**Vishesh** and **Shreyansh** ran a superb Boba Workshop this past weekend! They made a [website](https://clubmeeting.zeusnotfound.tech/), coordinated with Hack Club, then ran a successful event. It even included a chair train! ü™ë üöÇ

Chair trains are not the only way I can see a workshop was a blast. The websites were something to behold as well:

‚Ä¢ [Valorant](https://zakxiiii.github.io/Bobadrop-submissions/)  
‚Ä¢ [Digital Funhouse](https://hellosouls.github.io/boba-web/)

Websites were built and pizza was had on the *same day*. This event took planning, but offered (near) instant gratification for participants. Let's talk if you want to try this with your club!

I wonder how many ways I can insert 'get wrecked' into any conversation involving [#shipwrecked](https://app.slack.com/client/T0266FRGM/C08N0R86DMJ). Anyway, tell me about your club! - [@jps](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U07HEH4N8UV)
