# Build Stupid S#!T, Get Stupid Prizes 🏗️

We loved [Counterspell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5RPsCMl3uM) so much, we're throwing another worldwide event! Here's your chance to organize a hackathon in your city and be supported by Hack Club! We will help with things like:

- Funding 💰
- Training you as an organizer 🏋️‍♀️
- Themed swag 👕

But *seriously*, I can't recommend this enough. I attended Counterspell in Boston (shoutout to those organizers!), and it was an exceptional experience. I witnessed amazing projects of all skill levels, side-splitting laughs, and got to meet people I've only interacted with online. You're all club leaders, this is your opportunity to level-up your leadership skills!

## Leader Showcase 🏆

**Chaste** helped plan and facilitate **HackNoel**! They had over 60 teens attend and work on amazing projects! It was such a hit, they are planning another event called **Hack With Me** in August and expect 200 teens to attend and code for impact!

Here's a quick peek at the HackNoel attendees!

[Crop Guard](https://crop-guard.vercel.app/) was a project that came from HackNoel! It uses machine learning to identify different bird species. Once a bird is detected, it sends special sounds to scare them away without causing harm. This helps protect crops in an eco-friendly way! Check it out for yourself! Just make sure you're ready for a loud alarm sound 🚨
